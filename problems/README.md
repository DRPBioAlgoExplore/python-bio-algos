## Hill Climbing Challenge
In `hillclimbing.py` there are a couple functions that have various local maxima.
The challenge, however, is to find a global maximum within a region.

#### Tasks
1. **(NEW)** Write a genetic algorithm to find a global maximum.
  - Identify what "organisms" are in this context.
  - Determine what data structure will be useful for encoding this organism's "genome".
  - Pick a method for selecting the surviving population that will make it to the next round of evaluation.
  - Decide how reproduction will occur, using mutations and crossover (optional).

#### Recommended Reading

 - Chapter 3, pgs. 40-59 (can skip the 'Biological Background' if somewhat familiar, stop at 'Properties of Genetic algorithms')
